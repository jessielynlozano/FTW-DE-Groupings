# üõí InstaCart Online Grocery Basket dataset

This repository contains an end-to-end data pipeline built around the **InstaCart Online Grocery Basket dataset**, a real-world dataset that captures customer purchasing behavior across thousands of grocery orders.

## 1. Project Overview

- **Dataset Used:**  
  - InstaCart Online Grocery Basket Analysis Dataset

- **Goal of the Exercise:**  
  - Develop a business question, Apply Normalization ‚Üí Dimensional Modeling ‚Üí Data Quality Dashboard using the Instacart Market Basket dataset.

- **Team Setup:**  
  - The team collaborated by dividing responsibilities across data modeling, dashboard development, data quality testing, and documentation. Workloads were adjusted according to each member‚Äôs availability. 

- **Environment Setup:**  
  - Docker containers ran on a shared VM and local laptops, ensuring consistent and collaborative development.

## 2. Architecture & Workflow

- **Pipeline Flow:**
  ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[dlt ingestion] --> B[ClickHouse - raw schema]
        B --> C[dbt - clean schema]
        C --> F[Data quality testing]
        F --> D[dbt - mart schema]
        D --> E[Metabase dashboards]
  ```

- **Tools Used:**  
  - Ingestion: `dlt`  
  - Modeling: `dbt`
  - Data Quality: 
  - Visualization: `Metabase`  

- **Medallion Architecture Application:**  
  - **Bronze (Raw):** Initial ingestion of source data  
  - **Silver (Clean):** Cleaning, type casting, handling missing values  
  - **Gold (Mart):** Business-ready star schema for BI

## 3. Modeling Process

- **Source Structure (Normalized):**  
  To optimize for analytical queries, the data was restructured into a **star schema** with a central fact table and supporting dimension tables.

  - **Fact Tables:**  
    - `fact_orders` ‚Äì consolidated order-level data including customer, product, and time references.  
    - `fact_order_products` ‚Äì captured detailed order-product relationships (quantities, prices, and department linkage).

      ### üß© `fact_orders.sql`
      
      ```sql
      {{ config(
          materialized = "table",
          schema = "mart"
      ) }}
      
      SELECT
          o.order_id,
          o.user_id,
          dt.time_id,
          o.order_number,
          o.days_since_prior_order
      FROM
          {{ source('clean', 'grp24_instacart_orders') }} AS o
      LEFT JOIN
          {{ source('mart', 'grp24_instacart_dim_time') }} AS dt 
          ON o.order_dow = dt.day_of_week 
         AND o.order_hour_of_day = dt.hour_of_day


  - **Dimension Tables:**  
    - `dim_product` ‚Äì contained product details and their corresponding department and aisle.  
    - `dim_department` ‚Äì listed department names and IDs.  
    - `dim_aisle` ‚Äì represented product placement categories.  
    - `dim_user` ‚Äì included user or customer-related attributes.  
    - `dim_time` ‚Äì provided date and time breakdowns for trend analysis.
      
    ```sql   
    {{ config(materialized="table", schema="mart", tags=["mart","instacart"]) }}
    -- models/mart/2.4grp_instacart_dim_product.sql
    
    SELECT
        p.product_id,
        p.product_name,
        a.aisle,
        d.department
    FROM clean."2.4grp_instacart_products" AS p
    LEFT JOIN clean."2.4grp_instacart_aisles" AS a
        ON p.aisle_id = a.aisle_id
    LEFT JOIN clean."2.4grp_instacart_departments" AS d
        ON CAST(a.department_id AS String) = CAST(d.department_id AS String)
    WHERE p.product_id IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY
        p.product_id,
        p.product_name,
        a.aisle,
        d.department

## 4. Collaboration & Setup

- **Task Splitting:**  
  * Modeling: dbt SQL transformations
  * Visualization: Metabase dashboards
  * Data Quality: 
  * Documentation: README & presentation outline

- **Shared vs Local Work:**  
  *(Issues faced with sync conflicts, version control, DB connections, etc.)*  

- **Best Practices Learned:**  
  *(E.g., using Git for dbt projects, naming conventions, documenting assumptions, group debugging sessions.)*  

---

## 5. Business Questions & Insights

- **Business Questions Explored:**  
  1. What are the peak hours and days for order placements?

- **Dashboards / Queries:**  
  *(Add screenshots, SQL snippets, or summaries of dashboards created in Metabase.)*  

- **Key Insights:**  
  - *(Highlight 1‚Äì2 interesting findings. Example: ‚ÄúRock was the top genre in North America, while Latin genres dominated in South America.‚Äù)*
